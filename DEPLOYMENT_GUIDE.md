# Fashion Designer Studio - Deployment Guide

## How to Update Your Live Website (luminous-hotteok-245cee.netlify.app)

Your website is currently not updating because the changes need to be pushed to your Git repository. Here's how to set up automatic updates:

### Step 1: Connect Your Project to Git

1. **Create a GitHub Repository:**
   - Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and create a new repository
   - Name it something like `fashion-designer-studio`
   - Make it public or private (your choice)

2. **Push Your Project to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   # In your Replit terminal, run these commands:
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial fashion website setup"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Step 2: Connect Netlify to Your GitHub Repository

1. **Go to Your Netlify Dashboard:**
   - Visit [app.netlify.com](https://app.netlify.com)
   - Find your site: `luminous-hotteok-245cee`

2. **Update Site Settings:**
   - Go to Site Settings → Build & Deploy
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Set Build Command: Leave empty (no build needed)
   - Set Publish Directory: `/` (root directory)

3. **Enable Auto-Deploy:**
   - Once connected, Netlify will automatically deploy when you push changes to GitHub

### Step 3: Enable Netlify CMS (Admin Panel)

1. **Enable Netlify Identity:**
   - In Netlify Dashboard → Site Settings → Identity
   - Click "Enable Identity"
   - Under Registration, set to "Invite Only"
   - Enable Git Gateway in Services

2. **Create Admin User:**
   - Go to Identity tab in your Netlify dashboard
   - Click "Invite Users"
   - Enter your email address
   - Check your email and set password

### Step 4: Using the Draft/Publish System

Your admin panel now has enhanced functionality:

**Draft Mode Features:**
- **Save as Draft:** Products marked as draft won't appear on your live website
- **Editorial Workflow:** When enabled, you can:
  - Create multiple products as drafts
  - Review them in the admin panel
  - Publish multiple products at once
  - Schedule publications

**How to Use:**
1. Go to your admin panel: `luminous-hotteok-245cee.netlify.app/admin`
2. Login with your credentials
3. Create new products and check "Draft" to save without publishing
4. When ready, uncheck "Draft" to make products live
5. Use the "Editorial Workflow" tab to manage drafts and publish in batches

### Step 5: Making Updates

**For Content Changes:**
1. Use the admin panel at `/admin` to add/edit products
2. Changes automatically push to GitHub
3. Netlify automatically rebuilds and deploys your site

**For Code Changes:**
1. Make changes in Replit
2. Push to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your change description"
   git push
   ```
3. Netlify automatically deploys the changes
