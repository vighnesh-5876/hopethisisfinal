# Quick Fix: Sync Products to Your Live Site

## The Issue
Your site settings update through the CMS, but product changes made in Replit aren't syncing to your live Netlify site because the Git connection needs to be properly established.

## Immediate Solution

### Option 1: Download and Re-upload to Netlify
1. **Download your updated project files:**
   - In Replit, go to the file explorer
   - Download the entire project as a ZIP file
   - Extract the ZIP on your computer

2. **Upload to Netlify:**
   - Go to your Netlify dashboard
   - Find your site: `luminous-hotteok-245cee`
   - Go to "Deploys" tab
   - Drag and drop the extracted folder or use "Deploy folder"

### Option 2: Manual Git Setup (Recommended)
Since the automated Git setup has restrictions, you'll need to:

1. **Create a new GitHub repository:**
   - Go to github.com and create a new repository
   - Name it `fashion-designer-studio`

2. **Download your project and push manually:**
   - Download your Replit project as ZIP
   - Extract it on your computer
   - Open terminal/command prompt in the extracted folder
   - Run these commands:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fashion website with updated products"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/fashion-designer-studio.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. **Connect Netlify to your GitHub repo:**
   - In Netlify dashboard, go to Site Settings
   - Build & Deploy ‚Üí Continuous Deployment
   - Connect to Git provider (GitHub)
   - Select your repository

## Why This Happens
- Replit changes stay in the development environment
- Your live site reads from a Git repository
- Changes need to be "pushed" from development to the repository
- Netlify then automatically updates your live site

## Once Connected
After setting up the Git connection:
- Admin panel changes will automatically update your live site
- Product additions/edits sync within minutes
- Draft system will work perfectly for batch publishing

## Current Status
‚úÖ **Working:** Site settings, colors, contact info
‚ùå **Not Syncing:** Product changes, new products
üîÑ **Needs Setup:** Git repository connection

Would you like me to guide you through either option, or do you have access to set up the Git connection yourself?
